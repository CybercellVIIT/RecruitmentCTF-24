# ✨ Challenge Name: **The Midnight Rendezvous**

## 📜 Description
In the heart of a bustling city, Detective Jane is on the trail of two infamous hackers, known only by their aliases—Cipher and Ghost. An anonymous tip has led her to believe that the hackers are planning a clandestine meeting, dubbed the Midnight Rendezvous. However, the only clue she has is a seemingly ordinary text file titled "The Best of Times."

 However, Jane's experience tells her that something is amiss, especially given that the file size is a curious 330kB, which is unusually large for such a short piece of text.

Objective:
Your mission is to assist Detective Jane in uncovering the hidden communication within the text file. The goal is to extract the secret message that will reveal the details of the Midnight Rendezvous and help Jane thwart the hackers' plans.
