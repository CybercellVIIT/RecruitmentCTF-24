Welcome to the central repository for our **RecruitmentCTF-24** challenges! 🎯 Here, we collaboratively create and manage challenges for our CTF events. To ensure everything runs smoothly, please follow the guidelines below. Your contributions are greatly appreciated! 🙌

## 📂 Folder Structure

To keep things organized, please adhere to the following folder structure:

1. **Domain Categories**:
   - Each domain (e.g., Web, Crypto, Pwn) has its own folder in this repository.
   - Navigate to the appropriate domain folder where you will find sub-folders for individual challenges.

2. **Challenge Sub-folders**:
   - Inside the domain folder, create a sub-folder for your challenge. Name it using lowercase letters and dashes (e.g., `example-challenge`).

3. **Challenge Information**:
   - Within your challenge's folder, create a `README.md` file.
   - Use the [template](./templates/challenge-template.md) provided to ensure all necessary details are included. This helps maintain consistency across challenges.

## 🗓️ Deadline

Please ensure all challenges are submitted and updated by **8th August 2024**. This deadline helps us prepare everything in time for the event. ⏳
