# ✨ Challenge Name: Wi-fi Crack

## 📜 Description
```
Being a hacker by mentality I always keep track of my neighbours’ wi-fi password. Of-course I have my own internet connection, but it is always great to have the neighbourhood wi-fi passwords handy.
Unfortunately, last week I moved to a new locality and I don’t have an internet connection yet. My neighbour who lives beside me seems to be a decent netizen, although I got brushed off when I tried talking to him. Apparently, he is nick-named Brim-Zhö. Man - what a name. This guy seems to be a Panchatantra fan- which is kind of awkward since I hate cats. This is all I know about him and I desperately want his wi-fi password. Something about my human rights…blah..blah
My gut says his wi-fi password is of the flag format:
RecruitmentCTF{ Petsname+rto code of his region+his aadhar password}
```
